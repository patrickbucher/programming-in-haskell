# List Comprehensions

A list comprehension can be used to construct lists from rules:

    [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
    [1,4,9,16,25]

A list of all squares from 1 to 5 is built. The symbol `|` means _such that_,
and `<-` means _is drawn from_. The expression `x <- [1..5]` is called a
_generator_.

A list can be generated using multiple generators:

    [(x,y) | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [4,5]]
    [(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)]

The order of the generators affects the result's order:

    [(x,y) | y <- [4,5], x <- [1,2,3]]
    [(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5)]

The order is established like in a multiplication:

    (a + b) * (c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd

A later generator can access the expression of an earlier generator:

    [(x,y) | x <- [1..3], y <- [x..3]]
    [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)]

`concat` combines multiple lists to a single list:

    concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
    concat xss = [x | xs <- xss, x <- xs]

`firsts` uses the wildcard pattern to discard second tuple values:

    firsts :: [(a,b)] -> [a]
    firsts ps = [x | (x,_) <- ps]

`length` replaces every list item with `1` and sums it up:

    length :: [a] -> Int
    length xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs]

## Guards

_Guards_ are logical expressions to filter values in list comprehensions.

Often, a predicate function is used:

    [x | x <- [1..10], even x]
    [2,4,6,8,10]

The factors of a number can be found as follows:

    factors :: Int -> [Int]
    factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]

    factors 15
    [1,3,5,15]

    factors 7
    [1,7]

Prime numbers are numbers with only two factors, 1 and the number itself:

    prime :: Int -> Bool
    prime n = factors n == [1,n]

Using lazy evaluations, prime numbers can be found using a list comprehension:

    primes :: Int -> [Int]
    primes n = [x | x <- [2..n], prime x]
    primes 20
    [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]

`find`, when given a key to search for, returns a list of values belonging to
that key:

    find :: Eq a => a -> [(a,b)] -> [b]
    find k t = [v | (k',v) <- t, k == k']

    find 'a' [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3),('a',4)]
    [1,4]

## The `zip` Function

`zip` creates a list by pairing successive elements from two existing lists:

    zip [1,2,3] ['a','b','c']
    [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c')]

`pairs` uses `zip` to create a list of adjacent elements:

    pairs :: [a] -> [(a,a)]
    pairs xs = zip xs (tail xs)

    pairs [1,2,3,4]
    [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)]

`sorted` uses `pairs` to determine if a list is sorted in ascending order:

    sorted :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool
    sorted xs = and [x <= y | (x,y) <- pairs xs]

    sorted [1,2,3,4,5]
    True
    sorted [1,2,4,3,5]
    False

`positions` returns the indices of values found in a list:

    positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
    positions x xs = [i | (x',i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']

    positions True [True,False,False,True,False,True]
    [0.3,5]

Thanks to lazy evaluation, the infinite list `[0..]` is only evaluated up to
the point where all `xs` have been processed.

## String Comprehensions

Technically, a `String` is just a list of `Char` values, so list operations can
also be applied to strings.

    "foobar" !! 2
    'o'

    take 3 "foobar"
    foo

    length "foobar"
    6

    zip "abc" [1,2,3,4,5]
    [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3)]

Consequently, _string comprehensions_ are list comprehensions producing lists
of `Char` values.

`lowers` counts the number of lower-case letters in a string:

    lowers :: String -> Int
    lowers xs = length [x | x <- xs, x >= 'a' && x >= 'z']

    lowers 'abc'
    3
    lowers 'Foobar'
    6

`count` counts the number of occurences of a given character in a string:

    count :: Char -> String > Int
    count x xs = length [x' | x' <- xs, x == x']

    count 's' "Mississippi"
    4

## Exmample: Caesar Cipher

The _Caesar Cipher_ is a simple (and insecure) method to encrypt textual
information. Every letter of the alphabet is shifted by an offset, which again
can be used to decrypt the message.

`let2int` converts a character (letter) to an integer:

    let2int :: Char -> Int
    let2int c = ord c - or 'a'

`int2let` performs the opposite operation:

    int2let :: Int -> Char
    int2let n = chr (ord 'a' + n)

`ord` and `chr` are library functions, which convert from characters to integers
(unicode code point) and vice-versa, and need to be imported from `Data.Char`:

    import Data.Char

`shift` moves a letter by n positions, and makes sure the alphabet is wrapped at
the end:

    shift :: Int -> Char -> Char
    shift n c | isLower c = int2let ((let2int c + n) `mod` 26
              | otherwise = c

Only lower-case characters are shifted, other characters are left as they are.
`isLower` is a predicate (`Char -> Bool`) that checks if a character is a
lower-case letter.

The `shift` function can deal with both negative and positive offsets:

    shift 3 'a'
    'd'

    shift (-3) 'd'
    'a'

`encode` applies the `shift` function to an entire string using a list
comprehension:

    encode :: Int -> String -> String
    encode n xs = [shift n x | x <- xs]

    encode 13 "Hello, World!"
    "Hryyb, Wbeyq!"

    encode (-13) "Hryyb, Wbeyq!"
    "Hello, World!"

    encode (-13) (encode 13 "Hello, World!")
    "Hello, World!"

The Caesar cipher can be cracked (i.e. the shift factor can be found) using
_frequency tables_, since letters have different frequencies in natural
languages.

`percent` calculates a percentage using the `fromIntegral` library function,
which converts an integer to a float value:

    percent :: Int -> Int -> Float
    percent n m = (fromIntegral n / fromIntegral m) * 100

    percent 2 8
    0.25

Using `lowers` and `count` from the previous section, `percent` can be used to
calculate the frequencies in a string:

    freqs :: String -> [Float]
    freqs xs = [percent (count x xs) n | x <- ['a'..'z']] where n = lowers xs

    freqs "abbcccdddd"
    [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,...] -- omitted

The _chi-square statistic_ compares a list of observed frequencies (`os`) with
expected frequencies (`es`); the smaller the value, the better the match:

    chisqr :: [Float] -> [Float] -> Float
    chisqr os es = sum [((o-e)^2)/e | (o,e) <- zip os es]

`rotate` rotates a list by `n` items:

    rotate :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
    rotate n xs = drop n xs ++ take n xs

    rotate 3 [1,2,3,4,5]
    [4,5,1,2,3]

A pre-calculated frequency table for English is defined as follows:

    table :: [Float]
    table = [8.1, 1.5, 2.8, 4.2, 12.7, 2.2, 2.0, 6.1, 7.0, 0.2, 0.8, 4.0, 2.4,
             6.7, 7.5, 1.9, 0.1, 6.0, 6.3, 9.0, 2.8, 1.0, 2.4, 0.2, 2.0, 0.1]

The frequency of an encoded string is calculated:

    table' :: [Float]
    table' = freqs (encode 8 "there are a lot of programming languages out there")

`chisqr` and `rotate` can be combined to calculate the chi-square statistics of
the frequency of an encoded string (`table'`) and a pre-calculated frequency 
table (`table`):

    [chisqr (rotate n table') table | n <- [0..25]]
    [1672.7759,257.30905,1938.5552,1630.6279,956.50464,916.4745,1231.2474,
    335.0136,62.297523,2912.6172,401.4097,1875.3435,557.8009,2715.9778,
    258.70398,2111.4563,1120.2826,878.5908,2094.0308,373.97214,373.1325,
    346.10455,2472.9614,1230.1863,1386.4891,1470.9138]

The value with the index 8 (62.297523) is the lowest in the list, so likely
eight was used to encode the string.

Combined with the `positions` and `minimum` function, a `crack` function can be
defined:

    crack :: String -> String
    crack xs = encode (-factor) xs
               where
                   factor = head (positions (minimum chitab) chitab)
                   chitab = [chisqr (rotate n table') table | n <- [0..25]]
                   table' = freqs xs

    encode 7 "i like programming in haskell"
    "p sprl wyvnyhttpun pu ohzrlss"

    crack "p sprl wyvnyhttpun pu ohzrlss"
    "i like programming in haskell"

## Exercises

Ex. 1) Using a list comprehension, give an expression that calculates the sum
1^2 + 2^2 + â€¦ + 100^2 of the first one hundred integer squares.

    sum [n * n | n <- [1..1000]]

Ex. 2) Suppose that a _coordinate grid_ of size m * n is given by the list of
all pairs `(x,y)` of integers such that `0 <= x <= m` and `0 <= y <= n`. Using
a list comprehension, define a function `grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]`
that returns a coordinate grid of a given size. For example:

    > grid 1 2
    [(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]

    grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]
    grid m n = [(x,y) | x <- [0..m], y <- [0..n]]

Ex. 3) Using a list comprehension and the function `grid` above, define a
function `square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)]` that returns a coordinate square of
size n, excluding the diagonal from `(0.0)` to `(n,n)`. For example:

    > square 2
    [(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2.0),(2,1)]

    first (a,_) = a
    second (_,a) = a

    square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)]
    square n = [p | p <- grid n n, first p /= second p]

Ex. 4) In a similar way to the function `length`, show how the library function
`replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]` that produces a list of identical elements can
be defined using a list comprehension. For example:

    > replicate 3 True
    [True,True,True]

    replicate n x = [x | x <- [1..n]]

Ex. 5) A triple (x, y, z) of positive integers is _Pythagorean_ if it satisfies
the equation `x^2 + y^2 = z^2`. Using a list comprehension with three
generators, define a function `pyths :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)]` that returns
the list of all such triples whose components are at most a given limit. For
example:

    > pyths 10
    [(3,4,5),(4,3,5),(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]

    pyths n = [(x,y,z) | x <- [1..n], y <- [1..n], z <- [1..n], x*x + y*y == z*z]

Ex. 6) A positive integer is _perfect_ if it equals the sum of all of its
factors, excluding the number itself. Using a list comprehension and the
function `factors`, define a functon `perfects :: Int -> [Int]` that returns
the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit. For example:

    > perfects 500
    [6,28,496]

    head xs = take (length xs - 1) xs
    perfects n = [x | x <- [1..n], sum (head (factors x)) == x]

Ex. 7) Show how the list comprehension `[(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]]` with
two generators can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single
generators. Hint: nest one comprehension within the other and make use of the
library function `concat :: [[a]] -> [a]`.

    concat [[(1,a) | a <- [3,4]],[(2,b) | b <- [3,4]]]

Ex. 8) Redefine the function `positions` using the function `find`.

    positions x xs = find x (zip xs [0..])

Ex. 9) The _scalar product_ of two lists of integers `xs` and `ys` of length
`n` is given by the sum of the product of corresponding integers:

    sum from i=0 to n-1 of (xs_i * ys_i)

In a similar to `chisqr`, show how a list comprehension can be used to define a
function `scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int` that returns the scalar
product of two lists. For example:

    > scalarproduct [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
    32  

    scalarproduct xs ys = sum [x * y | (x,y) <- zip xs ys]

Ex. 9) Modify the Caesar cipher program to also handle upper-case letters.
